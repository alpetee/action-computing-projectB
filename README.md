This project is part of my Community Action Computing class and focuses on visualizing air pollution and renewable energy efforts. Specifically, it explores CO2 levels globally to better understand air quality trends and renewable energy efforts and their potential impact on communities.

### The Story
This project explores the relationship between renewable energy investments and their impact on carbon emissions. 
It aims to identify trends in carbon emissions across countries with varying levels of renewable energy investments,
analyzing how these efforts have led to measurable improvements in environmental outcomes.

### Context 
As I read through [the article](https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/california/los-angeles) that inspired the prework for this project,
I began to wonder how the air quality trends and pollutants related to renewbale energy efforts on a global scale. 

The goal of this data visualization is to understand how renewable energy initiatives affect carbon emissions over time, 
especially in the context of global efforts to reduce environmental impact. Through this visualization, I seek to address the question: Do countries that invest more heavily in renewable energy see a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions?

This data will reveal insights about the scale and pace of such efforts, contributing to the broader conversation on sustainable development.


### The Data 
The dataset I used provides information on global CO2 emissions and renewable energy efforts, specifically focusing on:

- **CO2 Emissions:** Total carbon dioxide emissions per country.
- **Renewable Electricity Output:** The percentage of total electricity generated from renewable sources.
- **Renewable Energy Consumption:** The percentage of total energy consumed from renewable sources.

I obtained this data from the [World Bank Databank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/environment-social-and-governance-(esg)-data#), which provides comprehensive, up-to-date environmental data for analysis.
### SwD Strategies 
- **Color**: I used color to create a heatmap, making the darker colors be higher scores and the ligher be lower. 
- **Chloropleth**: The chrolopleth provides geographic context. Using varying saturation of the same hue effectively highlights differences in data (p. 42).
- **Simple Text**: I kept text minimal in my slideshow, allowing the visuals to take center stage while leaving detailed explanations for my verbal presentation (p. 38).
 **Storyboarding**: Mapping out the flow of my story helped shape the structure of my visualization. This process led me to use a slider to display monthly trends (p. 31-33).
- **Big Idea**: I used this technique to develop a clear thesis and build my three-minute story around it (p. 31).
